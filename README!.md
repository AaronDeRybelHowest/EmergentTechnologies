#Emergent Technologies: AI

This is an overview about the structure and information of this code project
made for the course EmergentTechnologies

The directory [src](src) contains all the source code and scripts.
Other directories are standard directories that work with Pycharm.

The directory [Demo](src/Demo) contains `python scripts` and `jupyter notebooks`. 
Demos showcase simple examples of algorithms and workflow. For the Jupyter notebook it's best to show this 
in the browser.

The directory [Exercices](src/Excercices) contains all the exercices that need to be
filled in during the semester. It works exclusively with `jupyter notebooks`. 
Best to Fill in exercices from pycharm and not Browser. Will not be saved at every step otherwise  
Instructions how to use this can be found in the links section. 

The directory [OpenAIGym](src/OpenAIGym) contains an example of an untrained stabilizer.
The goal is to stabilize a stick on a cart. The OpenAI Gym environment is a physics simulator
using `Reinforcement Learning` to train towards a certain goal using a `decision-reward scheme`.
The robot hand seen during the first lesson is an example of this. More information can be found
in the links section.
